# Fetch - iOS Coding Challenge

#### This is a repo created for a take-home assignment

Please write a native iOS app that allows users to browse recipes using the
following API:

https://themealdb.com/api.php

There are 2 endpoints that your app should utilize:

-  https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.
-  https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID.

The user should be shown the list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted alphabetically.

When the user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detail view that includes:
-  Meal name
-  Instructions
-  Ingredients/measurements

Please read the following guidelines carefully before starting the coding challenge:
-  Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.
-  UI/UX design is not what youâ€™re being evaluated on, but the app should be user friendly and should take basic app design principles into account.
-  Project should compile using the latest version of Xcode.
